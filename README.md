# Text-Associator
The TextAssociator.java file implements hashing via the chaining method to create a personal thesaurus, meaning you can add different words and their associations as you see fit.

Run MyClient.java to test the methods of TextAssociator.java.

You can run the ThesaurusClient.java file, write anything you want, and the program will replace as much words from your input into with random associations of the word.

(NOTE: WordInfo.java was not created by me. It is code to use with the TextAssociator.java file. ThesaurusClient.java and large_thesaurus.txt was not created by me and is simply provided to display one of the uses of TextAssociator.java.)
